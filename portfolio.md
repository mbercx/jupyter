Most of my recent work has been on gathering and tidying up the Fireworks workflows I have developed for the various topics I've worked on during my PhD in the [vsc-workflows](https://github.com/mbercx/vsc-workflows) package. One example here is the [`PulayTask`](https://github.com/mbercx/vsc-workflows/blob/9bf33975f205076e9b7093dbd4cc2cbfa9e2ee65/vscworkflows/firetasks/core.py#L682), which aims to remove Pulay stresses by checking a user-specified condition with a certain tolerance (instead of relying on a double relaxation run). Over the past few weeks I've also been trying to optimize the VASP parallelization settings based on [several tests on our clusters](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbercx/jupyter/master?filepath=parallel%2Fparallel_analysis.ipynb), and implementing this in the [`VaspParallelizationTask`](https://github.com/mbercx/vsc-workflows/blob/master/vscworkflows/firetasks/core.py#L242). 

Below is a list of examples of other packages I've worked on. I'll show you the corresponding results during the interview:

- [pybat](https://github.com/mbercx/pybat/tree/master/pybat): This package contains the [`Cathode`](https://github.com/mbercx/pybat/blob/master/pybat/core.py#L63) subclass of `Structure`, which I've used for my work on Li-ion batteries. An important method here is [`Cathode.get_cation_configurations`](https://github.com/mbercx/pybat/blob/master/pybat/core.py#L514), which I've used to study Li configurations as well as Sn-substitution in Li2MnO3 based on the (now deprecated) [`get_wf_configurations`](https://github.com/mbercx/pybat/blob/master/pybat/workflow/workflows.py#L125).
- [cage](https://github.com/mbercx/cage): This is the first proper python package I've developed, mostly during my time at LLNL. The [`Cage`](https://github.com/mbercx/cage/blob/master/cage/core.py#L44) subclass of Molecule represents the polyborate (buckyball-like) molecules which we were investigating in the context of solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. The main goal here was to set up [`Landscape`](https://github.com/mbercx/cage/blob/master/cage/landscape.py#L32)'s along the [`Facet`](https://github.com/mbercx/cage/blob/master/cage/core.py#L1127)'s of the molecule to study the energy landscape of cations (Li, Na, ...) around the polyborate molecules.
- [quotas](https://github.com/mbercx/quotas): One of the other topics I've worked on is a model for the secondary electron emission from ion neutralization near a surface. This package contains the [`Qslab`](https://github.com/mbercx/quotas/blob/master/quotas/core.py#L42) subclass of pymatgen's `Slab` (which mainly add JSON serialization and some convenient extra methods), as well as the [`QuotasCalculator`](https://github.com/mbercx/quotas/blob/master/quotas/core.py#L298) class, which implements the model we designed for calculating the secondary electron emission yield. The required DFT input is calculated via [`get_wf_quotas`](https://github.com/mbercx/vsc-workflows/blob/master/vscworkflows/workflows/core.py#L475), which has been implemented in vsc-workflows.
- I had initially written all code for my work on solar cells in MATLAB, but decided to write a [python version](https://github.com/mbercx/jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/tools/slme.py) when I was contacted by Kamal Choudhary from NIST to collaborate on applying the [SLME metric](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.068701) to the [JARVIS database](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JARVIS.html). At the heart of this module is the [`SolarCell`](https://github.com/mbercx/jarvis/blob/master/jarvis/tools/slme.py#L543) class, which can be loaded from a vasprun.xml file and subsequently used to calculate the SLME and its predecessor, the Shockley-Queisser limit. Note that not the entire module was written by me, but most of the code up to line 850 is my work.
